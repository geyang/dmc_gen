# DMControl Generalization Benchmark
This code base is a fork-in-progress from [Hansen & Wang 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13389. Benchmark for generalization in continuous control from pixels based on [DMControl](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control).

 

## Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of the following papers in a unified framework:

- [SODA (Hansen and Wang, 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13389)
- [PAD (Hansen et al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04309)
- [RAD (Laskin et al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14990)
- [CURL (Srinivas et al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04136)
- [SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05905)

using standardized architecture and hyper-parameters, wherever applicable. 

## Setup

We assume that you have access to a GPU with CUDA >=9.2 support. All dependencies can then be installed with the following commands:

```
conda env create -f conda.yml
conda activate dmcgen
bash install.sh
```


## Datasets
Part of this repository relies on external datasets. SODA uses the [Places](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/download.html) dataset for data augmentation, which can be downloaded by running

```
wget http://data.csail.mit.edu/places/places365/places365standard_easyformat.tar
```

You should familiarize yourself with [their terms](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/download.html) before downloading. After downloading and extracting the data, add your dataset directory to the `data_dirs` list in `src/augmentations.py`.

The `video_easy` environment was proposed in [PAD](https://github.com/nicklashansen/policy-adaptation-during-deployment), and the `video_hard` environment uses a subset of the [RealEstate10K](https://google.github.io/realestate10k/) dataset for background rendering. All test environments (including video files) are included in this repository, namely in the `src/env/` directory.


## Training & Evaluation

The `scripts` directory contains training and evaluation bash scripts for all the included algorithms. Alternatively, you can call the python scripts directly, e.g. for training call

```
python3 src/train.py \
    --algorithm soda \
    --aux_lr 3e-4 \
    --seed 0
```

to run SODA on the default task, `walker_walk`. This should give you an output of the form:

```
Working directory: logs/walker_walk/soda/0
Evaluating: logs/walker_walk/soda/0
| eval | S: 0 | ER: 26.2285 | ERTEST: 25.3730
| train | E: 1 | S: 250 | D: 70.1 s | R: 0.0000 | ALOSS: 0.0000 | CLOSS: 0.0000 | AUXLOSS: 0.0000
```
where `ER` and `ERTEST` corresponds to the average return in the training and test environments, respectively. You can select the test environment used in evaluation with the `--eval_mode` argument, which accepts one of `(train, color_easy, color_hard, video_easy, video_hard)`.


## Results

SODA demonstrates significantly improved generalization over previous methods, exhibits stable training, and has a sample efficiency that is comparable to the baseline SAC. Average return of SODA and baselines in the `train` and `color_hard` environments is shown below.

We also provide a full comparison of the SODA, PAD, RAD, and CURL methods on all four test environments. Results for `video_easy` and `color_hard` are shown below:
